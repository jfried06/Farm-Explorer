Hello! This is the documentation for Martha's Farm on how to implement our Farm Explorer code.


Squarespace
-----------------------
There are a few steps to getting our code to work on Squarespace:

1. Create a New Page
- Create a new "Blank Page" on your Squarespace site.
- This page will host the "Farm Explorer".

---

2. Access Code Injection
- Select the Farm Explorer page you just created.
- In the left sidebar, go to:  
  "Utilities -> Website Tools -> Code Injection".

---

3. Add HTML and JavaScript
In the "Header" section:
1. Paste the full contents of FarmExplorer.html.
2. Directly underneath, paste the following:
    <script>
    (Paste the contents of FarmExplorer.js here)
    </script>
- Click "Save" (top-left corner) to confirm changes.

---

4. Add Custom CSS
- Return to "Website Tools".
- Click on "Custom CSS".
- In the CSS text box, paste the contents of FarmExplorer.css.

---

5. Upload Images
- In the "Custom CSS" area, open the "Custom Files" dropdown.
- Upload all images you want to use for Farm Explorer.

---

6. Get Image URLs
- After uploading, click each uploaded file to get its Squarespace-hosted URL.
- Copy each URL into a document (such as Word, Notepad, etc.) for easy access.
- Important:
  Remove any auto-added URL links from the Custom CSS text box â€” leave only your original CSS code there.

---

7. Update Image References in CSS
- In your pasted CSS code, find any references to image files, e.g.:
    background: url('map.png') no-repeat center center;
- Replace the filename (like 'map.png') with the full URL from Squarespace:
    background: url('https://static1.squarespace.com/path-to-your-map.png') no-repeat center center;
- Make sure to keep the single quotes around the URL.

---

8. Update Image References in HTML and JavaScript
- In your injected HTML and JavaScript code (from Step 3):
  - Find any image names like imageName.png or imageName.jpg.
  - Replace each with the corresponding Squarespace URL.

---

Notes
- Always double-check the full paths of your images.
- Make sure the URLs stay within single quotes wherever they are used.
- Save your changes frequently during setup.

Miscellaneous
-----------------------

If for any reason you ever need to update the background map image of the farm with other artwork, simply replace the current map.png file with another image. Alternatively, line 5 in 'FarmExplorer.css' can be changed from map.png to whatever your new image is called.

If you need to change the position of the waypoint icons to accommodate a new background map image, open 'FarmExplorer.html' and look at lines 15-39. Here you'll find the data for all the waypoints which are all labelled so you can easily identify which is which. For each waypoint you will see a bit of text that says: ;style="top: XX%; left: XX%;'. To change the position of a waypoint, simply change these parameters so that the waypoint's position matches the desired location.

Hello! This is the documentation for Martha's Farm on how to implement our Farm Explorer code.


Squarespace
-----------------------
There are a few steps to getting our code to work on Squarespace:

1. Create a new Blank Page on your Squarespace site to house the Farm Explorer.

2. Next the Farm Explorer page, click on the gear that shows up next to the name. From there, click Navigation, then uncheck both the Show Header and Show Footer options. 

3. Under the same settings page as the previous step, find Advanced. From there, paste the contents of FarmExplorer.html into the text box that says Page Header Code Injection. Under that in the same box, paste the following: 

	1. <script>
	2. (the contents of FarmExplorer.js)
	3. </script>

Now you can leave the settings page.

4. Under Website Tools, click Custom CSS. Add the contents of FarmExplorer.css to whatever is currently in the text box labelled Custom Files.

5. 

Miscellaneous
-----------------------

If for any reason you ever need to update the background map image of the farm with other artwork, simply replace the current map.png file with another image. Alternatively, line 5 in 'FarmExplorer.css' can be changed from map.png to whatever your new image is called.

If you need to change the position of the waypoint icons to accommodate a new background map image, open 'FarmExplorer.html' and look at lines 15-39. Here you'll find the data for all the waypoints which are all labelled so you can easily identify which is which. For each waypoint you will see a bit of text that says: ;style="top: XX%; left: XX%;'. To change the position of a waypoint, simply change these parameters so that the waypoint's position matches the desired location.

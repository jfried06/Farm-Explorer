Hello! This is the documentation for Martha's Farm on how to implement our Farm Explorer code.


Squarespace

Miscellaneous
-----------------------

If for any reason you ever need to update the background map image of the farm with other artwork, simply replace the current map.png file with another image. Alternatively, line 5 in 'FarmExplorer.css' can be changed from map.png to whatever your new image is called.

If you need to change the position of the waypoint icons to accommodate a new background map image, open 'FarmExplorer.html' and look at lines 15-39. Here you'll find the data for all the waypoints which are all labelled so you can easily identify which is which. For each waypoint you will see a bit of text that says: ;style="top: XX%; left: XX%;'. To change the position of a waypoint, simply change these parameters so that the waypoint's position matches the desired location.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to Dr. Cooney or any of us at these emails:

Here are the changes implemented from our UI tests:

1. More readable text on side paneling. Not only did we increase its size, but we also boldened it. 
2. Location text over waypoint icons. Now the user doesn't need to click on the waypoint to know which location it refers to.
3. Scrollable map. Now when the side panels are open, the user can scroll the map in the background.
4. Additional text under info buttons. Now it's more clear which buttons are which when the user opens a side panel.

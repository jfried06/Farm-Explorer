Here are the changes implemented from our UI test:

1. More readable text on side paneling. Not only did we increase its size, but we also boldened it. 
2. Location text over waypoint icons. Now the user doesn't need to click on the waypoint to know which location it refers to.
3. Labels under the volunteer, workshop, and fun fact icons. Now the user will be more easily able to know what each icon represents.
4. Scrollable background. Now users can scroll to view any location waypoints that may be shifted to far right once a given info panel is opened.
